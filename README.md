## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel, but can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js applications.

For Vercel deployment:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js project and configure the build settings
3. Deploy the project and Vercel will provide you with a live URL

For other platforms, follow their respective documentation for deploying Next.js applications.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure to add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file to keep sensitive information secure.
